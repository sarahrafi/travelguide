    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Haeundae Beach</h1>
    <p class="data">  Haeundae Beach is one of the most Famous beaches in South Korea. 
         The peak of Busan's beaches is on the coast of the Haeundae District in eastern Busan. The great allure of this sandy shoreline has sparked incredible development in the last couple of decades, 
         and the beach is now skirted by a crescent of supertall skyscrapers like Haeundae LCT The Sharp, Haeundae Doosan, and the Zenith, both above 300 meters. </p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Gwangalli Beach</h1>
        <p class="data">  Curling around for 1.4 kilometers, and more than 100 meters across places in Busan, Gwangalli Beach has soft, fine sand and high water quality after improvements in recent years. You'll never go hungry at Gwangalli Beach as there are more than 300 restaurants, cafes, and sushi bars within a few steps.
             What will hit you right away is the view of the mammoth Gwangandaegyo suspension bridge spanning the bay a few hundred meters out to sea. The shore here is the best place to catch the bridge's LED light show after dark. More than a million people gathered at the beach and the promenade behind for the Busan International Fireworks Festival,
              one of the largest fireworks events in Asia and held across two evenings in late-October. </p>
